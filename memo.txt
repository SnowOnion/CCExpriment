Development Schedule

[Restart] [21, May, 2018] Preparation for Project NGramModel.
[Keep Moving 1] [22, May, 2018] Run the project with no error. Define and fix some classes.
[Keep Moving 2] [22, May, 2018] Support the type parameter. Implement the function trainBasicNGramModel in the class BasicNGram, and it needs to be tested critically.
[Keep Moving 3] [23, May, 2018] Improve the code in class Tokensequence(splitSequence etc.)
[Keep Moving 4] [23, May, 2018] Simple test on the class BasicNGram, run with no errors.
[Keep Moving 5] [24, May, 2018] Redefine hashCode() in class Tokensequence and optimize the structure of the project.
[Keep Moving 6] [24, May, 2018] Find the corpus, and commit.
[Keep Moving 7] [25, May, 2018] Try a new implementation of hashCode() in class Tokensequence.
[Keep Moving 8] [25, May, 2018] Define interface AppRunNGram and CacheNGram which is the subclass of BasicNGram.
[Keep Moving 9] [28, May, 2018] Define class Tokenstream to pack input token. Function importStreamFromFile in Tokenstream has not been well defined.
[Keep Moving 10] [28, May, 2018] Succussful run and correct output. Structure of code need to be polished. Class and functions relevant to Type var K need to be redesigned.
[Keep Moving 11] [29, May, 2018] Merge dataset2 into dataset1.
[Keep Moving 12] [29, May, 2018] Add configuration file, and begin to implement multiple training files importer.
